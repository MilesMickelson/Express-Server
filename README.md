# Node101-Express-Server
Second project in the Node101 course at San Diego Code School, this simple project demonstrates creating 
an Express server with a .json file in the backend and creating a route to it for a user to see 
that files data.

Please feel free to demo the project by taking these steps.. 

1. Clone or fork the repo 
2. $ npm install 
3. $ npm start (which will build and run on local server 3000)
4. Open up your browser to view on localhost 3000

Thank you, Miles Mickelson
